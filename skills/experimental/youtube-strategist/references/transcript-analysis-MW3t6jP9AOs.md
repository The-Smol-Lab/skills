"[music] How can we get cloud code works well as your codebase became more and more complicated without getting to circles and make you feel frustrated? Once I learned that there are many things you can do to improve performance dramatically through good context engineering and context engineering basically means how you can optimize what goes into conversation history thread for the cloud code or codeex so that only relevant and necessary information are included here to guide agents next actions.
