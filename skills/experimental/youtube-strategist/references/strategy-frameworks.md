# Strategy Frameworks

## Content gap scan

- Map existing top videos by angle, length, and audience level.
- Identify what is missing: beginner vs advanced, practical vs theory, demos vs commentary.
- Prioritize gaps that match the user's expertise and channel identity.

## Title pattern heuristics

- Use clear outcomes: "How to X in Y minutes".
- Add specificity: numbers, timeframes, tool names.
- Encode audience: "for beginners", "for teams", "without API keys".

## Hook patterns

- Outcome-first: promise the end result in the first 10 seconds.
- Contrarian insight: lead with what competitors are missing.
- Credibility cue: why the creator knows the answer.

## Differentiation levers

- Fresh angle: newer tools, updated workflows, clearer constraints.
- Proof: benchmarks, demos, or real-world examples.
- Structure: better pacing, fewer digressions, clean takeaways.

## Competitive positioning

- Compare top 3 videos on clarity, depth, and delivery.
- Identify where you can be shorter, clearer, or more practical.
- Aim for one strong differentiator, not ten small ones.
